*This Addendum supplements, but does not replace, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPLv3). Where conflicts arise, AGPLv3 controls. This Addendum expresses additional conditions, values, and expectations for the use of TRUSTINT and its artifacts.*

---

## 1. Provenance & Integrity
- All redistributions or derivative works **must preserve provenance**. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Commit history and version identifiers.
  - Tamper-evident logs (e.g., SHA256SUMS, signed artifacts).
  - Audit trails of material changes.
- Removal of provenance headers, signatures, or lineage information is prohibited.

---

## 2. Continuity & Collapse Clauses
- In the event of **systemic disruption** (e.g., ecological collapse, infrastructural breakdown, suspension of civic governance), TRUSTINT and its artifacts **automatically revert to full public domain status** for purposes of survival, continuity, and knowledge preservation.
- Under such conditions, no entity may restrict or enclose access to TRUSTINT.

---

## 3. Usage Restrictions
- TRUSTINT and derivative works **may not be used for**:
  - Mass surveillance or systems designed primarily for invasive monitoring.
  - Weapons development or military applications.
  - Proprietary SaaS or service enclosures that deny provenance or source.
- TRUSTINT and derivative works are encouraged for:
  - Civic continuity and community resilience.
  - Education, research, and open knowledge.
  - Stewardship of ecological, cultural, and intergenerational assets.

---

## 4. Idempotency & Integrity
- All derivatives should preserve **idempotent behavior**: identical inputs must yield reproducible outputs.
- Silent alterations of outputs, without logging or disclosure, are prohibited.

---

## 5. Governance & Trusteeship
- Operators of TRUSTINT are considered **stewards, not owners**.
- Derivative works should, wherever feasible, implement **multi-party governance** (e.g., quorum, multi-sig, or trustee/protector models).
- Unilateral control over critical decisions is strongly discouraged.

---

## 6. Artifacts & Knowledge Vaults
- All artifacts produced by TRUSTINT (including but not limited to deeds, matrices, ledgers, and simulation logs) must remain exportable in **open formats** (e.g., JSONL, CSV, Markdown, PDF).
- Enclosure of outputs in proprietary formats without open equivalents is prohibited.

---

## 7. AI & Agent Clauses
- AI systems or autonomous agents derived from TRUSTINT must:
  - Preserve provenance headers and attribution in outputs.
  - Carry forward continuity and collapse-aware provisions.
  - Avoid misrepresentation or stripping of context.

---

## 8. Attribution & Symbolic Continuity
- Derivative works must preserve attribution to the TRUSTINT project and original authors.
- Symbolic continuity (e.g., use of ðŸ•¸, medallions, or equivalent covenantal markers) is encouraged in derivative forks to maintain shared lineage.

---

## 9. Interpretive Guidance
- This Addendum is intended as an **ethical covenant** as well as a legal notice.
- Enforcement may be cultural, reputational, or contractual in addition to any remedies under AGPLv3.
- Communities and operators are encouraged to extend these clauses as **living governance documents**.
