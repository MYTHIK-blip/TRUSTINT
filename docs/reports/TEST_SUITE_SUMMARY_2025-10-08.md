### TRUSTINT Daemon Test Suite Summary
**Report Timestamp:** â¬¡ 2025-10-08

A total of 25 tests were executed, all of which passed, confirming the stability and correctness of the TRUSTINT daemon's core functionalities. The tests are organized by the components they validate.

---

#### **`tests/test_db_contracts.py` (4 tests)**
These tests validate the integrity and correctness of the database schema and its contracts, which are fundamental to the **Substrate (TIS)** layer.

*   **`test_db_journal_mode_is_wal`**: Confirms the database is set to "Write-Ahead Logging" (WAL) mode, which is crucial for concurrent read-write performance and data integrity.
*   **`test_db_foreign_keys_are_on`**: Ensures that foreign key constraints are enabled, which is vital for maintaining relational integrity between tables (e.g., ensuring an asset cannot belong to a non-existent trust).
*   **`test_fts5_is_available`**: Verifies that the FTS5 (Full-Text Search) extension for SQLite is compiled and available, which is required for the `trustint search` functionality.
*   **`test_schema_version_is_present`**: Checks that the `schema_version` table exists and contains a valid version number, which is essential for managing database migrations.

---

#### **`tests/test_idempotent.py` (1 test)**
This test ensures that core operations are idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.

*   **`test_ingest_is_idempotent`**: Verifies that running the `trustint ingest` command multiple times with the same configuration does not create duplicate entries in the database, a cornerstone of the daemon's deterministic behavior.

---

#### **`tests/test_lattice.py` (1 test)**
This test focuses on the **Lattice (TIL)**, the governance and rule-checking engine.

*   **`test_validate_finds_orphaned_assets`**: Confirms that the `trustint validate` command correctly identifies "orphaned" assets (assets assigned to a trust that does not exist in `trusts.yaml`), preventing inconsistent data from being ingested.

---

#### **`tests/test_provenance.py` (9 tests)**
These tests are the most critical for ensuring the integrity of the append-only provenance ledger. They validate the `utils/provenance.py` module from end to end.

*   **`test_load_key_from_env`**: Confirms a valid HMAC key can be loaded from the `TRUSTINT_HMAC_KEY` environment variable.
*   **`test_load_key_from_binary_file`**: Confirms a raw binary key can be loaded directly from the `.hmac_key` file.
*   **`test_load_key_from_b64_file`**: Confirms a base64url-encoded key can be loaded from the `.hmac_key` file.
*   **`test_key_generation`**: Ensures that a new, secure 32-byte HMAC key is automatically generated if no key is found in the environment or filesystem.
*   **`test_invalid_env_key_fails`**: Verifies that the system gracefully handles and rejects a key from the environment variable that is too short.
*   **`test_invalid_file_key_fails`**: Verifies that the system rejects a key file with an invalid format.
*   **`test_wrong_size_binary_key_fails`**: Confirms that a binary key file with an incorrect byte length is rejected.
*   **`test_keygen_outputs_b64`**: Checks that the `prov_tools keygen` utility produces a valid, 43-character base64url-encoded key.
*   **`test_chain_verification_with_different_key_sources`**: An end-to-end test proving that events can be appended and the entire ledger can be verified successfully, even when the key source changes between environment variables, binary files, and text files.

---

#### **`tests/test_provenance_key_formats.py` (7 tests)**
These tests perform a deep dive into the specific formats and sources of the HMAC key, ensuring the loading mechanism is robust and flexible.

*   **`test_load_key_from_env_base64url`**: Specifically tests loading a valid base64url-encoded key from the environment.
*   **`test_load_key_from_env_hex`**: Specifically tests loading a valid hex-encoded key from the environment.
*   **`test_load_key_from_binary_file`**: Tests loading a raw binary key from a file.
*   **`test_load_key_from_base64url_file`**: Tests loading a base64url-encoded key from a file.
*   **`test_generate_new_key_if_none_exist`**: Confirms that key auto-generation works as expected in a clean environment.
*   **`test_key_too_short_fails`**: Verifies that both environment- and file-based keys are rejected if they are below the minimum required length (16 bytes).
*   **`test_non_standard_key_length_warns`**: Ensures the system loads but issues a warning for keys that are valid but not the recommended 32 bytes in length.

---

#### **`tests/test_rules.py` (3 tests)**
These tests validate the business logic and rule enforcement within the **Lattice (TIL)**.

*   **`test_rule_has_trustee`**: Checks that the validation logic correctly identifies if a trust is missing a designated "trustee" role.
*   **`test_rule_has_settlor`**: Checks that the validation logic correctly identifies if a trust is missing a "settlor".
*   **`test_rule_has_jurisdiction`**: Ensures that the validation logic confirms every trust has a defined jurisdiction.

All documentation has been updated, and the test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the daemon's core functionality, especially its critical provenance and database integrity layers.
